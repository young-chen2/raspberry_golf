/* Young Chen, CS 107e.
Declares a variety of essential string-related functions bare-metal, including:
memcpy to write all bytes at one section of memory to another section.
memset to write an integer value to a sectino of memory.
strlen to obtain the length of a null-terminated char array.
strcmp to compare lexicographically two char arrays.
strlcat to concatenate one chunk of memory to the end of another.
strtonum converts a given string to its numerical representation.

Functions operate via manipulation of memory directly with minimal safeguads.
Users should be cognizant not to overwrite any pre-established, un-declared,
or invalid pieces of memory.
