/* Young Chen, CS 107e
 Uses main driver function, backtrace, to trace from the innermost
 to outermost frames in a function call given the current frame pointer.
 Uses helper function name_of to retrieve, by virtue of offset
 memory access from compile-time memory layout, the name of the
 executing function in a particular frame.
 Prints out, as a result of backtrace, the particular address of
 the caller, followed by the name of the caller, and finally
 the offset from the first instruction of the caller to the current
 fp of the caller.

/* Returns the name of a particular frame given the address
 where the frame starts. Uses the layout of registers, in particular,
 that the first 4-byte address below the start address contains in
 its first byte whether or not a name for the function has been
 set at compile-time and in its last three bytes the length of the
 function name.
 name_of uses bit masking to access both pieces of information, using
 the length of the word encoded to back up to the memory address
 the word starts at and returns the word as a const char array.
 If the word is not encoded, return ???.
