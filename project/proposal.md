## Project title

## Team members: Young Chen, Boxin Zhang

## Project description
We're trying to innovate & upgrade the classic arcade game: Whac-A-Mole!
Using buttons (4 each) on two breadboards to use as gaming consoles in adversarial mode, we create a PvP Whac-A-Mole game that initializes an underlying 2D array and graphics library to create a smooth graphical interface.

## Hardware, budget
We intend on using our full budget to purchase accelerometers, distance sensors, MIDI output mics, etc. We still need to figure out what exact parts we need to purchase.

## Major tasks, member responsibilities
We will be collaborating on all parts of the project and meeting in person to collaborate constantly. Broadly, Young will focus more on graphics / software while Boxin focuses on hardware / protocols.

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
Our one-week goal for next week is a simple version of Whac-A-Mole with 6 buttons and a simple graphical display for the game.

## Resources needed, issues
We're concerned about evelating our idea and challenging ourselves to the fullest on this assignment. We are open to help with ideating how to integrate sensors into our project & potentially using PI-to-PI communication & other complex concepts in Whac-A-Mole.
